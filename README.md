# MAV delay exploratory data analysis
*MAV is the state owned hungarian railway company, notorious for delays. The software in this
repository aims to find the causes and show the trends in the delays. 
Made for the Big Data course of Budapest University of Technology and Economics*

## Data origin
Two data sources were used in the analysis:

    - Delay cause data
    - Train location and delay data

The first source was obtained by scraping the public MAV webpage starting from 2022.10.05.
The second source was given to us by u/gaborauth on reddit, who made a great interactive [webpage](https://mav-stat.info/)
on the same topic. We are thankful for his efforts.
